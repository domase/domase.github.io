    "description": "I'm an Assistant Professor at the University of Rochester Department of Physics and Astronomy.  I also hold a Visiting Scientist appointment at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics. I'm primarily interested in observations of the very youngest protostars, in particular how asymmetric infall from the larger environment can influence properties of potentially planet-forming disks.  Ultimately I seek to unite dust, kinematic, chemical, and polarization observations of embedded protostars at multiple wavelengths and size scales to form a more nuanced picture of star and planet formation. I specialize in high-resolution (sub-arcsecond) interferometric observations. I also work closely with my theorist co-investigators.",

Our work with the Class I protostar IRS 63 shows that the same features are already present at an evolutionary stage when the protostar will still gain significant mass from the surrounding envelope. The dust rings will act as an early foothold for dust grain growth, which is a prerequisite of planet formation. All together, this work is compelling evidence that protostars and planets grow and evolve together from very early times.",

Our study is the first to attempt to characterize embedded disk sizes in a complete and unbiased sample of an entire molecular cloud. The VANDAM survey has a resolution of ~15 au at 8 mm, and we found that 14 Class 0 and 4 Class I protostars had disks greater than 12 au in radius, based on modeling in the uv-plane. This left 78% of the protostars in our survey without clear signs of disks found.  These small radii at long wavelengths likely represent a lower limit on disk size, and while it is clear that large (greater than 10 au) disks can indeed exist even in the youngest Class 0 phase, large young disks are uncommon even with these high resolution data.",

L1527 is a well-known and edge-on Class 0 protostellar disk, and the first Class 0 disk to be confirmed via detection of Keplerian rotation. This work is the first to detect resolved polarization emission arising directly from a Class 0 disk. If the polarization is caused by spinning dust grains aligned with magnetic fields, then it is consistent with a toroidal magnetic field wrapped around a rotating disk. This suggests that at 50 au scales, the angular momentum transport in Class 0 protostars is driven by magnetorotational instabilities rather than magnetocentrifugal winds.  Since this paper was published, many other mechanisms for producing polarized emission in embedded disks have been found (such as self-scattering). Meanwhile, the morphology of the polarized emission in this edge-on Class 0 disk remains an observational benchmark for any proposed polarization mechanism.",
